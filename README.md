# SQL server database file provider for Essential JS2 File Manager 

This repository contains the SQL server database file provider in ASP.NET Core for the Syncfusion File Manager component.

## Key Features

The SQL FILESTREAM feature provides efficient storage, management, and streaming of unstructured data stored as files on the file system.

The SQL server database file provider serves the file system support for the FileManager component in SQL server database.

The following actions can be performed with the SQL server database file provider.

| **Actions** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Read      | Read the files from SQL table. |
| Details   | Gets a file's details which consists of Type, Size, Location and Modified date. |
| Download  | Downloads the selected file or folder from the SQL table. |
| Upload    | Uploads a file to the SQL table. It accepts uploaded media with the following characteristics: <ul><li>Maximum file size:  30MB</li><li>Accepted Media MIME types: `*/*` </li></ul> |
| Create    | Creates a New folder. |
| Delete    | Deletes a folder or file. |
| Copy      | Copys the selected Files from target. |
| Move      | Pastes the copied files to the desired location. |
| Rename    | Renames a folder or file. |
| Search    | Full-text queries perform linguistic searches against text data in full-text indexes by operating on words and phrases. |

## Prerequisites

Make the SQL server connection with SQL database file ([App_Data/FileManager.mdf](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider/tree/master/App_Data)) and specify the connection string in "Web.config" file as specified in below code example.

```

<add name="FileExplorerConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Trusted_Connection=true" />

```

Also need to add the entry for the connection string in the [`appsettings.json`](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider/blob/master/appsettings.json) file as specified in below code example.

```

{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "FileManagerConnection": "Data Source=(LocalDB)\\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\App_Data\\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30"
  }
}

```

To configure the SQL server database connection use the `SetSQLConnection` method to set the connection name, table name and rootId of the table.

```
  
  SetSQLConnection(string name, string tableName, string tableID)

```

## File Manager AjaxSettings

To access the basic actions such as Read, Delete, Copy, Move, Rename, Search, and Get Details of File Manager using the SQL server database file provider service, just map the following code snippet in the Ajaxsettings property of File Manager.

Here, the `hostUrl` will be your locally hosted port number.

```
  var hostUrl = http://localhost:62870/;
  ajaxSettings: {
        url: hostUrl + 'api/SQLProvider/SQLFileOperations'
  }
```

## File download AjaxSettings

To perform download operation, initialize the `downloadUrl` property in ajaxSettings of the File Manager component.

```
  var hostUrl = http://localhost:62870/;
  ajaxSettings: {
        url: hostUrl + 'api/SQLProvider/SQLFileOperations',
        downloadUrl: hostUrl + 'api/SQLProvider/SQLDownload'
  }
```

## File upload AjaxSettings

To perform upload operation, initialize the `uploadUrl` property in ajaxSettings of the File Manager component.

```
  var hostUrl = http://localhost:62870/;
  ajaxSettings: {
        url: hostUrl + 'api/SQLProvider/SQLFileOperations',
        uploadUrl: hostUrl + 'api/SQLProvider/SQLUpload'
  }
```

## File image preview AjaxSettings

To perform image preview support in the File Manager component, initialize the `getImageUrl` property in ajaxSettings of the File Manager component.

```
  var hostUrl = http://localhost:62870/;
  ajaxSettings: {
        url: hostUrl + 'api/SQLProvider/SQLFileOperations',
         getImageUrl: hostUrl + 'api/SQLProvider/SQLGetImage'
